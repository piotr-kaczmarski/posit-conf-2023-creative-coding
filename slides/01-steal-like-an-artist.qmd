That's a big question to ask

Pinterest from me and Ije

Sum of your influences

Mash up of everything you like

You already like stuff - start collecting it if you don't already!

## How do you start?

Free yourself from the burden of being original!

Copy, and keep copying.

## Recreate

### Copying is reverse engineering

We'll be going over 4 pieces for this workshop - reverse engineering each one, breaking them down (that's what the graph paper is for!)

By recreating each, you'll learn techniques for creative coding

## Remix

### A perfect copy is hard

Where do you fall short? What makes you different? Amplify that, and transform it

![Â ](01-steal-like-an-artist/imperfect-copy.jpg)

::: notes
Make changes to copies based on what you like - you don't have the _exact_ same taste or style as your influences!
:::

## Reinterpret

### Once you know how to copy...

Move on from imitation to emulation

You don't want to [look]{.under} like your influences, you want to [see]{.under} like them
