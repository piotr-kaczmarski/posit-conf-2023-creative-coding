## Communication Strategy

* Github discussion will be used only for sharing outputs from certain exercises. 
* Please feel free to ask questions at any time during the workshop. 
* There will be exercises where you will be asked to draw on graphing paper. If this is not accessible to you, feel free to use other software for drawing, use the solutions, or skip to the next part of the exercise.
